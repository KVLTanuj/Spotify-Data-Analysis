# Spotify-Data-Analysis
We intend to gain valuable insights by exploring Spotify's music data and quantifying it in this article. We will analyze Spotify data using sentiment analysis, analyzing how audio features of a song relate to its lyrics in terms of sentiment.

# Exploring the World of Spotify Data Analysis using Python
Today, music streaming services have revolutionized how we listen to our favourite songs. Spotify, a Swedish streaming and media services provider founded in April 2006, is one of the major players in this field. With over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paid subscribers, Spotify is undoubtedly the largest music streaming service in the world.
The objective of this article is to explore Spotify's music data and quantify it in order to gain valuable insights. Through sentiment analysis, we will analyze Spotify data in depth, analyzing the relationship between the audio features of a song and the sentiment it conveys through its lyrics.

## Understanding the Data
Before we dive into the analysis, let's take a closer look at the datasets we'll be working with.

### Spotify Tracks Dataset
The "tracks.csv" dataset provides information about various tracks on Spotify, including details such as track names, popularity, durations, explicit content, and artists.

### Spotify Audio Features Dataset
In addition to the tracks dataset, the SpotifyFeatures.csv dataset contains audio features of the tracks, including danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentality, liveness, valence, tempo, and time_signature. A machine learning algorithm is used to extract these audio features from each track's audio signal and can assist us in understanding the song's musical characteristics.
With a basic understanding of the data, let's move on to the analysis.
## Importing Libraries and Data
First, we need to import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. We'll be using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for this purpose.
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
Next, let's load our datasets into Pandas DataFrames:
```python
# Load the Spotify Tracks dataset
tracks_df = pd.read_csv('tracks.csv')
# Load the Spotify Audio Features dataset
audio_features_df = pd.read_csv('SpotifyFeatures.csv')
```
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With our data loaded, it's time to perform some exploratory data analysis to get a better understanding of the datasets.

### Basic Statistics
Let's start by checking some basic statistics of the data, such as the number of rows and columns and the summary statistics.
```python
# Check the shape of the datasets
print("Shape of tracks_df:", tracks_df.shape)
print("Shape of audio_features_df:", audio_features_df.shape)

# Display summary statistics for the audio features
print("Summary statistics for audio features:")
print(audio_features_df.describe())
```
### Data Visualization
Visualizations are a powerful way to gain insights from the data. We can create various plots to explore trends and relationships within the data.

#### Popularity Distribution
```python
# Plot the distribution of track popularity
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(tracks_df['popularity'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Track Popularity')
plt.xlabel('Popularity')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```
#### Correlation Heatmap
```python
# Create a correlation heatmap for audio features
corr_matrix = audio_features_df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Audio Features')
plt.show()
```
## Sentiment Analysis
Now, let's add another layer to our analysis by performing sentiment analysis on the lyrics of songs. To do this, we can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries such as NLTK or TextBlob.
First, we'll need to obtain the lyrics of the songs. There are various APIs and datasets available for this purpose. Once we have the lyrics, we can use TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
``` python
from textblob import TextBlob
# Sample code to perform sentiment analysis on song lyrics
lyrics = "I'm feeling good today. It's a wonderful world."
blob = TextBlob(lyrics)
sentiment = blob.sentiment
# Print sentiment scores (polarity and subjectivity)
print("Sentiment Polarity:", sentiment.polarity)
print("Sentiment Subjectivity:", sentiment.subjectivity)
```
## Conclusion
Using Python, we examined the world of Spotify data analysis. We started by understanding the datasets, performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights, and even discussed sentiment analysis as an addition to our analysis pipeline.
There are countless opportunities for further exploration in music and data analysis. By analyzing the data more deeply, you can create machine learning models that predict the popularity or genre of songs, or even recommend songs to users based on their preferences.
Music enthusiasts and data scientists alike will find Spotify's data a rich source of exploration and analysis.
